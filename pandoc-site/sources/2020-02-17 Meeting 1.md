# Week 1 Meeting 2/17

- No meeting next week (due to retreat)
- Regular schedule TBD (when2meet!)

## Pytorch (40m)
- [Pytorch 60min blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
- Check the advice sections below for what to focus on in the tutorial.
- Would recommend either running the Jupyter notebook or using Google Colab and setting the runtime to 'Hardware accelerator: GPU' if you want GPU access
- Should have Colab and Jupyter links on each page of the tutorial

### [What is Pytorch?](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-tensor-tutorial-py)
Make sure you know how to do the following:
- How to construct empty, random, all-ones, and all-zeros tensors
- How to specify tensor datatype
- Create a tensor with the same shape as another tensor, but a different datatype
- Look up tensor operations
- Add, subtract and [multiply](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44524901/how-to-do-product-of-matrices-in-pytorch) tensors
- Convert between Numpy arrays and tensors
- Move tensors between CPU and GPU

## Universal Music Translation Network (40m)
- Read paper
- Look at GitHub
- Results from CSUA

## CSUA account setup & Colab (40m)
- Go to CSUA soda office
- Set up CSUA accounts
- Run Jupyter notebook on CSUA

## Seq2Seq tutorial (40m)
- https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html

## ToneNet (40m)
- https://towardsdatascience.com/tonenet-a-musical-style-transfer-c0a18903c910

> 1. Week of 2/10
>    1. Lecture: Introductions, overview of sequence-to-sequence problems and the UMTN
>    2. Workshop: Pytorch tutorial (maybe [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) though I didn't like it as much. Might want to make some custom tutorial stuff).
>    3. Homework: None
